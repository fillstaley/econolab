# Boltzmann Banking Model

This is a very simple model of an economy.
It comprises two types of agents: individuals and banks.
Individuals wish to give each other money.
This money takes the form of bank deposits held in account at the banks.
The banks provide a "means of payment" by effecting the transfer of funds from one account to another.
